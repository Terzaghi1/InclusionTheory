# Computing poroelastic stresses with inclusion theory

This repository contains example MATLAB files to compute the analytical solution for the stresses induced by uniform pore pressure changes inside a subsurface reservoir. We consider a two-dimensional plane strain case. The reservoir geometry is characterized by its total width, the reservoir height, the fault throw, and the dip angle.

### example_F1.m
MATLAB code which produces figures of the stress field for a faulted reservoir with dip angle < 90 degrees.

### example_F1_fault
MATLAB code which produces figures of the stresses along the fault for a faulted reservoir with dip angle < 90 degrees.

### example_F2.m
MATLAB code which produces figures of the stress field for a faulted reservoir with dip angle > 90 degrees.

### example_F2_fault
MATLAB code which produces figures of the stresses along the fault for a faulted reservoir with dip angle > 90 degrees.

### Notes_TriangularInclusion.pdf
Description on how to use the analytical solution for displacements, strains, and stresses for a triangular inclusion of a specific orientation to obtain the displacement, strain, and stress field for triangular inclusions with different orientations.
